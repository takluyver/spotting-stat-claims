# Spotting statistical claims

Full Fact Hackathon at PyData London 2017

We are scanning text to identify statistical claims. We look for numbers,
monetary amounts, percentages, and terms such as 'increase' or 'decrease'. We
try to avoid false positives, such as "Article 37".

This works with XML files [from this Hansard data set](https://fullfact.org/media/hansard.zip).
